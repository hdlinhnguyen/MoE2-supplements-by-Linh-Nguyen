Hello-Bonjour,

It is the supplement files for my thesis. 

This master's thesis is one part of my internship under the supervision of [Prof. Vincent Martinet](https://sites.google.com/site/martinetvincent/home?authuser=0) (at INRAE) whom I owe a debt of gratitude.

In particular, this repo will show you all my code that is equivalent to some specific parts of my thesis. 
Please click on each file to read the single file you want.

Thank you and have a nice watching!
