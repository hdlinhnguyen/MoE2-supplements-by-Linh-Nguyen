Hello-Bonjour,

It is the supplement files for my thesis. 

This master thesis is one part that belongs to my internship at INRAE under supervision of [Prof. Vincent Martinet](https://sites.google.com/site/martinetvincent/home?authuser=0).

In particular, this repo will show you all my code that is equivalent to some specific parts of my thesis. 
Please click on each file to read the single file you want.

Thank you and have a nice watching!
